How to Use Cabbage Maggot Forecasts

<div class=plain_back_j style="width:500;">
<p>Adult flights can be predicted based on degree-day (base 40&deg;F) accumulations. Highest risk of infestation is typically during the peak (50% emergence) from the first and second adult flights, though later generations can also be damaging. Peak flights are indicated by the red dashed lines on the degree-day accumulation chart. Seedlings, transplants or root crops present around the time of peak flights should be protected by an insecticide treatment or with row covers. Insecticides are applied just prior to planting; row covers must be iun place well before adults begin to emerge. See the 
<a href="http://veg-guidelines.cce.cornell.edu/15frameset.html" target="_blank">Cornell Integrated Crop and Pest Management Guidelines for Commercial Vegetable Production</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Risk of infestation in outdoor production is negligible after October 15, so row covers can be removed at that time.</p>
