How to use Cabbage Maggot forecasts
</div>

<div class=plain_back_j style="width:500;">
<p>Adult flights can be predicted based on degree-day (base 40&deg;F) accumulations.  Small plants are at highest risk during the peak (50% emergence) of the first and second adult flights.  Peak flights are indicated by the red dashed lines on the degree-day accumulation graph.  Plants that emerge or are transplanted around the time of peak flights should be protected by an insecticide treatment.  If row covers are used, they must be applied well before adult begin to emerge. See the 
<a href="http://veg-guidelines.cce.cornell.edu/15frameset.html" target="_blank">Cornell Integrated Crop and Pest Management Guidelines for Commercial Vegetable Production</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The third and fourth generation flights are generally smaller and pose less risk to transplants of cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower, but damage to late season brassica root crops does occur.  Floating row cover or insecticides can be used to protect crops from damage.  Risk of additional infestation is negligible after October 15, so row covers can be removed at that time.</p>
