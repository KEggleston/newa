About Cabbage Maggot
</div>

<div class=plain_back_j style="width:500;">
<p>Cabbage maggot is a pest of cabbage, broccoli, radish, turnips and related (cruciferous) crops and weeds.   Adult flies lay their eggs at the base of plants and larvae tunnel in stems and roots, damaging marketable portions, interrupting the flow of water and nutrients, and creating wounds for pathogens and secondary organisms. Light infestations can kill small seedlings and transplants, delay plant development, or render root crops like radish unsalable; high populations can kill older plants or reduce yield.  There are four generations a year in New York.</p>
