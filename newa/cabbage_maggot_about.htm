About Cabbage Maggot
</div>

<div class=plain_back_j style="width:500;">
<p>Cabbage root maggot larvae tunnel in stems and roots of susceptible plants, interrupting the flow of water and nutrients to the aboveground parts of the plant.  Adult flies lay their eggs at the base of plants and larvae hatch and begin tunneling into the stems and roots.  Heavy infestations can kill small seedlings and transplants, and cause older plants to wilt and have reduced yield.  Lighter infestations can delay development and make the plant more vulnerable to bacterial pathogens.  Brassica root crops such as radish and turnip suffer direct damage to edible parts, reducing their marketability.</p>
